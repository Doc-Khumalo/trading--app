#Trading Web-App

##Build Built Using React's <code>create react-app</code> command

This is a quick mock up of a trading web-app that I created.
To be able to run this build, navigate to the "my-app" folder and then in terminal, run <code>install react-scripts</code>
Then after the install is complete, run <code>npm start</code>. this will build the app and then launch the view in your browser http://localhost:3000/
